A regex intro so gentle it doesn't even contain a regex.  
If you'd like to get to the nitty gritty, skip to Part 2.

I know regular expressions: https://xkcd.com/208/

Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems.

Regular Expressions are typically used for user input validation.
Another good fit is extracting, deleting and/or reorganising text.
Replace a dozen lines of `Substring` and `IndexOf` with one 'pretty' regex!

Other usage in code might be suspect: does the readability really benefit from the regex
or does it just make things more complex.

Be sure to have Unit Tests for all input you'd like to support.  
You'll need them whenever requirements change or bugs need to be fixed.

Even with this seemingly limited applicability - if you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot that is -
Regexes are still a very useful tool as they can be used in many one time actions.
- Find in (all project) files in your IDE
- Quickly find the interesting stuff in big files (think logs, data dumps, csvs, etc)
- Convert data that came from A to what B likes
- Many a CLI tool or its parameters understand regex

These are the reason this series is posted under the productivity category.

**An example**

Whenever I fix a bug that was the result of an error that might have happened in other places aswell,
I might use a regex to find those, even if the other code contains different variables, styling etc it
would still find them - at least if the regex was written in a way that takes the context into account.

^(\d+);(\d+);\d+;(\d+);(?:[^;]+;){8}([^;]+);.*
$1;$2;$3;$4


**Tooling**

Don't forget about tooling.
Having direct feedback on what your regex is matching on your data set as you type it.. It's the best :)

TODO: Add some links to regex online tools + downloadable tool? Visual Studio Code also has this

**Implementations**

As if they are not confusing enough in themselves, there are different implementations of regex.
TODO: refer to part 3 implementations

**Other resources**

TODO: put the interesting yaml front matter links here.

**Mastering Regular Expressions**

Even though the name of the book is [Mastering Regular Expressions][mastering-regex-book]
it still starts really slow and is perfectly readable by someone with even no (or very little) regex experience.


**Moving on**

Did I already mention that you'll want to have tests of the code using regexes, especially if they tend
to change often? Don't be shy to write them, even if they are the only ones in your repository.
